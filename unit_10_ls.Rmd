# Class Announcements

1. The Regression Lab begins next week.  
    - Your instructor will divide you into teams.
    - As part of the lab, you will perform a statistical analysis using linear regression models.

# Roadmap

## Rearview Mirror

- Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.

- The BLP is a useful way to summarize the relationship between one outcome random variable $Y$ and input random varibles $X_1,...,X_k$

- OLS regression is an estimator for the Best Linear Predictor (BLP)

- We can capture the sampling uncertainty in an OLS regression with standard errors, and tests for model parameters.

## Today

- The research goal determines the strategy for building a linear model.

- Description means summarizing or representing data in a compact, human-understandable way.

- We will capture complex relationships by transforming data, including using indicator variables and interaction terms.

## Looking Ahead

- We will see how model building for explanation is different from building for description.

- The famous Classical Linear Model (CLM) allows us to apply regression to smaller samples.


# Discussion

## Three modes of model building

- Recall the three major modes of model building: Prediction, Description, Explanation.
- What is the appropriate mode for each of the following questions?

 1. What is going on? 
 2. Why is something going on? 
 3. What is going to happen? 
 
- Think of a research question you are interested in.  Which mode is it aligned with?

## The statistical modeling process in different modes

- How does the modeling goal influence each of the following steps in the statistical modeling process?

  - Choice of variables and transformation

  - Choice of model (ols regression, neural nets, random forest, etc.)

  - Model evaluation

# R Activity: Examining the Wage and Experience Relationship

- Our goal is description: what is the relationship between experience and wages?  We will proceed in two steps:
    - First, we will discuss what the appropriate specifications are. 
    - Then we will estimate the different models to answer this question.
- We will use wage1 dataset in the wooldridge package in the following sections.
```{r}
#?wage1
#names(wage1)
```

## Transformations

###  Applying and Interpreting Logarithms
- Which of the following specifications best capture the relationship between experience and hourly wage? (Hint: Do a quick a EDA)

    - level-level: $wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 exper + u$
    - Level-log: $wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(exper)  + u$
    - log-level: $\ln(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 exper + u$
    - log-log: $\ln(wage) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(exper) + u$

- What is the interpretation of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ in your selected specification? 
- Can we use $R^2$ or Adjusted $R^2$ to choose between level-level or log-level specifications?

### Remember

- **Doing a log transformation for any reason essentially implies a fundamentally different relationship between outcome (Y) and predictor (X) that we need to capture**

\newpage 

###  Applying and Interpreting Polynomials

- The following specifications include one control variable: years at current company (tenure).
- Do a quick EDA and select the specification that better suits our description goal.

    - $wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 exper + \beta_2 tenure + u$


    - $\begin{aligned}
wage &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 exper + \beta_2 exper^2 +  \beta_3 tenure + \beta_4 tenure^2 + u 
\end{aligned}$

- How do you interpret the $\beta$ coefficients? 


### Applying and Interpreting Indicator variables and interaction terms

- In the following models, first, explain why the indicator variables or interaction terms have been included. Then identify the reference group (if any) and interpret all coefficients.

     - $wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 exper + \beta_2 female + u$

    - $wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 exper + \beta_2 female + \beta_3 exper*female + u$

    - $\begin{aligned}
wage &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 female + \beta_2 I(exper = 2) + \beta_3 I(exper = 3)+...+ \beta_{51} I(exper = 51) + u\\
\end{aligned}$


## Estimation

### Estimating Returns to Experience

- Answer the following questions using an appropriate hypothesis test.
  1. Is a year of experience associated with changes to hourly wage? (Include tenure without polynomial terms). 
  2. Is the association between wage and experience / wage and tenure non-linear?
  3. Is there evidence for gender wage discrimination in the U.S.?
  4. Is there any evidence for a diminishing relationship between wage and experience?
- Display all estimated models in a regression table, and discuss the robustness of your results.
